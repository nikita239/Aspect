Welcome to a brand new version of N2 CMS.

This release brings a few minor improvements, bugfixes and some potentially 
breaking rearrangements in the code (check the FAQ for upgrading help). jQuery 
and TinyMCE components were also upgraded. The whole changelog is here.

I havn't assembled all the source codes yet, but if you're in a hurry you may 
get it from the svn repository. If you're new to N2 I'd anyhow recommend you 
start with the Examples (below).
