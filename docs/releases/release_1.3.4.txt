
The focus for this release is the editing experience. The interface has undergone a facelif and I've finally added a lazily loaded (ajax) tree menu that should speed things up on large sites. Also, it's easier to sort pages, and you can preview changes before they are published.

Other changes include a more understandable installer, and a few programmability improvements in the form of a couple of new expression builders and a helpful web control. All of this is topped with minor api improvements and a thin layer of bugfixes.

First time with N2?

    * Download some examples (below). Run in visual studio to figure out the basics.
    * Look at the documentation
    * Try a working implementation
    * Planning to build a site on top of the templates? I can recommend using the templates example (below) as a starting point.


Enjoy!
