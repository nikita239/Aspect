N2 is a lightweight CMS framework for ASP.NET. It helps you build great web 
sites that anyone can update.

Major Changes
The content adapter concept (a layer of indirection that allows control over 
aspects external to the solution). Small tweaks of the editing and drag/drop 
experience. A file operations API. Some improvements in the ASP.NET MVC area.

Beyond this a significant number of improvements and bugfixes were contributed 
by eteewhy, jemerick and mikekidder. It means a lot, thank you =)
