N2 is a lightweight CMS framework for ASP.NET that helps you build great web 
sites that anyone can update.

Major Changes
Thanks to questions and pain reports the primary target for this release was
the installation experience along with a more understandable configuration. I
hope a lot more things will work out of the box or with a little configuration.

Functionality-wise there are new parts for login and user registration and a 
whole slew of minor tweaks and fixes. Also upgraded tinymce, and nhibernate.

First time with N2?
* Try the demo site
* Download templates + sample project (below) and open the project in Visual Studio.
* Look at the [url:documentation

Upgrading?
* Create a backup of the site and database
* Read upgrade_1.4.txt (there's a few breaking changes)
* Drop the compiled runtime

Enjoy!
