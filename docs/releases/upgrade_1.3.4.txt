Some possibly breaking changes might be custom toolbar plugins or 
IDataItemContainers but for most solutions a recompile should do it.

If you extended the code in the templates project you'll need to fix some 
compile errors. There is also a new master page that includes the menu instead 
of parts. Please post in the forum if you're having troubles in this area.
