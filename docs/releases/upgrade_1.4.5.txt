Make a complete backup, delete /edit, any /Templates folders drop upgrade files and recompile your solution.

Instructions:
- Delete /App_Browsers/MaintainPostbackUrl.browser
- Add to web.config in /configuration/system.web/pages:
			<tagMapping>
				<!-- This maintains the friendly urls during postbacks -->
				<add tagType="System.Web.UI.HtmlControls.HtmlForm"  mappedTagType="N2.Web.UI.WebControls.RawUrlForm"/>
			</tagMapping>

Breaking changes:
- ContentItem.AddTo(Control) is removed, implement N2.Web.Parts.
- Zone.AddedItemTemplate and Zone.GettingItemTemplate are now frowned upon, they still work but disable the parts adapter
