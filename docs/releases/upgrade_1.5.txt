Make a complete backup (including database), delete /edit, any /Templates folders, drop upgrade files and recompile your solution.

Upgrade hints:
- PageDefinition & PartDefinition are now reccomended for defining pages and parts
- [Page/PartDefinition("The Title", TemplateUrl = "/path/to/the/template.as?x")] is preferred for referincing the template

Possibly breaking changes:
- Overriding ContentItem.IconUrl now only works in the tree. Use [PageDefinition("the title", IconUrl = "/path/to/the/icon.gif")] or [PartDefinition...] to change the new item screen.
- The user "admin" may have less permissions than before in some cases. Please create a membership user with roles instead.
- [ReplacesParentDefinition] now defaults to remove the parent definition and assume it's discriminator (use parameters to maintain old behaviour where the parent was just disabled)
