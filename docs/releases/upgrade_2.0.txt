Make a complete backup (including database), delete /edit and /bin, drop upgrade files and recompile your solution.

Breaking changes:
- .NET 3.5 (or greater) is now required
- N2.Web.HtmlHelper is now deprecated and renamed to FormsHelper (to avoid conflicts with MVC)
- Adapters are not decorated with [Adapts] attribute rather than [Controls] and are not shared between instances
- Management interface is moved from /edit to /n2/content
- N2.Edit has been renamed to N2.Management
- Action<T> and Function<T> have been replaced with their equivalent in .NET 3.5
- Some namespaces have changed (e.g. Castle, Installation)
- The Alpha MVC templates have undergone a lot of changes (see http://n2cms.codeplex.com/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=208270)
