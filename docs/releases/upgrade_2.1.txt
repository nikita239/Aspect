Make a complete backup (including database), delete /n2, /edit and /bin, drop upgrade files and recompile your solution.

Breaking changes:
* LINQ doesn't currently work (as well as before)
* Shared[Parts|Pages] -> Shared/[Part|Page]Templates (changes convention)
* SMTP settings are no longer configured on the root page, use the standard .NET configuration instead, e.g.:
	<system.net>
	   <mailSettings>
		  <smtp from="someaddress@somehost.com">
			 <network host="mail.somehost.com" password="xxxxxx" port="25" userName="someaddress@somehost.com"/>
		  </smtp>
	   </mailSettings>
	</system.net>
