N2 CMS Compiled Templates Release

ABOUT

These is a proposed implementation built with the N2 CMS engine. You can use it
as it is or change as you like. You can download the source code from codeplex.

If you're not planning on changing the existing templates or, if you can live 
with subclassing and extending it might be a safer choice for upgrade to use 
compiled templates and using a custom project. There's an example for this.

To learn development with N2 CMS visit http://n2cms.com/Documentation.aspx and
download the example at http://www.codeplex.com/n2/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx.

INSTALLATION

If you have SQL Server 2005 Express installed it should be enough to put the
file in an IIS directory and run. To install in another database read install.txt
